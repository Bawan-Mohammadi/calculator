# calculator

This is my third project and my first project using JavaScript.
It is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean and familiar design.
The main goal of this project was to learn JavaScript fundamentals and understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements and user input.

✨ Features :
   Basic arithmetic operations:
        Addition (+),
        Subtraction (−),
        Multiplication (×),
        Division (÷),
    Clear (C) button,
    Backspace (delete last input),
    Real‑time display update.
    🛠️ Built With
    HTML – structure,
    CSS – styling and layout,
    JavaScript – logic and interactivity.
